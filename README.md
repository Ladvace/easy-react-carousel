 An easy, simple and light react carousel 
</p>

## Why?
Bored of installing heavy components full of stuff that you don't need that sometimes are not even made in react ?
If you are looking for a light carousel component, fully made in react this is the right solution for you

## Installation
### Basic

```
npm i easy-react-carousel
```

## Usage
By default, the component does not need anything except for an array of object (slides) passed by the prop ```slides```.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Carousel from 'easy-react-carousel'

const slides = [
    {
      title: // title ,
      description: // description,
      id: // every slide must have a unique id,
      image: // the image url,
      url: // this is used to redirect to the url page when you click on the slide
    },
    // ...
]

const Carousel = () => (
  <Carousel
    slides={slides}
  />
);

export default Carousel;
```
